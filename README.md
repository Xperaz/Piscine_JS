## How to submit
When a blood scene is in progress, we actively utilize Github's Pull Request to submit & evaluate!

1. The first thing to do is fork this repository to your current account.
2. `(본인 intra id)/(서브젝트 이름)`(e.g. `sunpark/js00`) to create a branch.
3. Commit your progress while working hard on solving problems.
4. Submit a Pull Request to this repository within the submission period .
	> - Fork that repo.
	> - Push to your repo, and then send a pull request to this repo.
	> - pull request title format: `[Subject] Slack ID *일차` (eg `[FE00] PolarBear 1일차`)
5. At the end of the submission period, we will designate reviewers as reviewers. We schedule the evaluation with the designated reviewers <strong>within the evaluation period</strong> . (The evaluation paper will be uploaded to Slack)
6. When the evaluation is completed, the evaluation result sheet is captured so that the score, evaluator, and person being evaluated can be seen and submitted along with the feedback.

All deadlines are based on Github server time. Submissions that do not comply with the deadline will receive 0 points unconditionally.

> 🚨Do not commit, force-push, or change the contents of the PR branch after the deadline. This will also be considered as submissions that do not comply with the deadline and will be awarded 0 points.

> 🚨Also, in the PR, only the files related to the subject should be modified and submitted. Submissions that do not comply with these items will be awarded zero points.

## 🏊‍♀️ What is Piscine?

Piscine is the French word for 'pool'. Fishin at 42 is a training course in which people who can't swim are suddenly thrown into a pool and learn to swim in order to survive, and in the same way that when learning a new programming language, they are given only problems without teaching, like heading to the ground when learning a new programming language.

To enter 42, you must pass the selection process C Piscine, so Piscine at 42 is a familiar curriculum. There are scenes in various languages ​​in this course, and there are also scenes made by 42 students themselves. A typical example is [42AI](https://github.com/42-AI)'s [Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python).
